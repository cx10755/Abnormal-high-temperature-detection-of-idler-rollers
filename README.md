# Abnormal-high-temperature-detection-of-idler-rollers
As a part of belt conveyors that is prone to high temperatures, it is particularly important to conduct temperature detection on idlers. The detection cost of traditional sensors is too high and maintenance is difficult. Infrared detection performs poorly in terms of detection accuracy and false detection under the influence of long distances, open-air scenes, extreme weather, etc. At present, the detection methods based on machine vision cannot strike an effective balance between detection accuracy and computational cost. To solve the above problems, this project proposes an HGGH-YOLO detection model and an infrared image dataset of abnormally high temperatures of idlers.The project code update and dataset supplementation will be continuously completed in the future.
